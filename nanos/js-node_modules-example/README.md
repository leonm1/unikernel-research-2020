# Node.js with Dependencies example

This example demonstrates how Node.js dependencies may be included in the Nanos unikernel. Note that this drastically increases the image size of the unikernel, as node.js dependencies are not generally light. Use of a bundler may be used to partially alleviate this concern.

Running this code will result in an error, as the unikernel does not implement a DNS resolver to be able to fetch the model and the model may not be loaded from a file:// url due to checks in the tfjs library.

This example may be run, with the [ops tool](https://github.com/nanovms/ops) and npm installed, with the following commands:

```bash
npm i # Install node.js dependencies to node_modules

ops load node_v11.5.0 -f -n --config config.json
```
