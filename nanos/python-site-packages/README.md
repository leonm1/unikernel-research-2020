# Nanos VMs Ops with Python Site Packages

This folder is designed to demonstrate the ability for nanos vms ops to attach python packages and shared libraries into the unikernel image. The `config.json` file contains shared library entries to enable the `onnxruntime` package to run in the unikernel, but the runtime fails to run due to missing glibc symbols in the unikernel environment

The `config.json` file should be updated with machine-local paths for each user running the example, which is a major downside of this technology when compared to docker.

Running the example can be accomplished by installing the Nanos VMs [ops](http://ops.city) tool and entering the following in a terminal in this directory:

```bash
ops load python_3.6.7 -c config.json
```
